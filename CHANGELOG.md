## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure with Cargo workspace
- WebSocket proxy with BSATN tag byte inspection (read/write classification)
- Raft consensus integration via openraft
- State machine that forwards committed writes to SpacetimeDB
- CLI tool (`rtdb`) with cluster management commands
- Docker Compose setup for local 3-node cluster
- Dockerfile with multi-stage Rust build
- Persistent Raft log store using redb (pure Rust, ACID) — survives restarts
- TLS encryption for inter-node Raft RPCs and management API (`--tls-cert`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-ca-cert`)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`GET /metrics`) with Raft term, leader status, connections, write latency, entries applied
- Health check endpoint (`GET /cluster/health`) — returns 200 when leader known, 503 otherwise
- Leader discovery endpoint (`GET /cluster/leader`) — returns current leader ID and address
- Client reconnection hints — WebSocket close frames include `leader=<id>:<addr>` on graceful shutdown
- Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C / SIGTERM handling, coordinated task shutdown, and 5-second drain period
- Snapshot caching for fast new-node catch-up
- Helm chart and K3s manifests for Kubernetes deployment
- End-to-end Docker cluster test script
- GitHub Actions CI for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Multi-shard (Multi-Raft) support — each SpacetimeDB module can run in its own Raft group for parallel write throughput
- `RaftPool` replaces `RaftNode` — manages multiple Raft groups with per-shard state machines, forwarders, and log stores
- Shard-aware Raft RPC routing (`/raft/{shard_id}/append`, `/raft/{shard_id}/vote`, `/raft/{shard_id}/snapshot`)
- Shard management API: create shards, add/remove module routes, list shards, per-shard status
- Shard configuration replicated via Raft consensus (0xFF magic byte in shard 0's log) — no external config store
- Per-shard persistent log stores at `{data_dir}/shard-{id}/raft-log.redb` with automatic migration of legacy files
- Module-based shard routing — WebSocket proxy extracts module name from path and routes writes to the correct shard
- CLI shard commands: `create-shard`, `add-route`, `remove-route`, `list-shards`, `shard-status`
- Membership changes (`add-node`/`remove-node`) now propagate to all active shards
- Full backwards compatibility — existing single-shard clusters work with zero config changes (shard 0 is the default)

# Contributing to RaftTimeDB

Thanks for your interest in contributing! RaftTimeDB is early-stage and there's a lot to build.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable): https://rustup.rs
- **Docker** (for running SpacetimeDB locally): https://docker.com
- **SpacetimeDB CLI** (optional, for publishing modules): https://spacetimedb.com/install

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NodeNestor/RaftimeDB.git
cd RaftTimeDB
cargo build
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Running Locally (Docker Compose)

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up
```

This starts a 3-node cluster. Connect to `ws://localhost:3001`.

## What Needs Work

Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NodeNestor/RaftimeDB/issues) for current priorities. The big areas:

### Completed
- ~~Cluster bootstrap (initial leader election)~~
- ~~Persistent log store (redb)~~
- ~~TLS encryption for inter-node communication~~
- ~~Prometheus metrics~~
- ~~Client reconnection hints on failover~~
- ~~Graceful shutdown and connection draining~~
- ~~Snapshot support for node catch-up~~
- ~~Health check and leader discovery endpoints~~

### Completed (Phase 3)
- ~~Multi-Raft (one Raft group per SpacetimeDB module)~~
- ~~Shard management API and CLI~~
- ~~Module-based shard routing~~

### Phase 4: Further Scaling
- Shard splitting and rebalancing
- Per-shard membership subsets (not all nodes in all shards)

### Phase 5: Kubernetes Operator
- `SpacetimeCluster` Custom Resource Definition
- Auto-scaling based on connection count / memory
- Rolling upgrades with zero downtime

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` pass
4. Write a clear PR description explaining what and why
5. Submit!

## Code Style

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix warnings
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for non-obvious logic (but don't over-comment)
- Error handling: use `anyhow` for applications, `thiserror` for libraries

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions
- **Discussions**: Architecture decisions, design proposals
